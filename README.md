# 🌟 Blockchain-Inspired Student Sponsorship Platform  
*A transparent donation lifecycle simulation built with **Python + Streamlit + SQLite***  

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **mock blockchain-powered charity sponsorship platform** demonstrating how fintech, smart contracts, and transparency mechanisms can improve trust in charitable funding.

It simulates an end-to-end transparent workflow:

1. Donor funds a student  
2. Student becomes **fully funded**  
3. NGO uploads **proof of fund usage**  
4. App simulates **7-second smart-contract verification**  
5. Proof becomes **Verified**  
6. Funds automatically **Release** to the student  
7. Admin fee is charged **only once** at release  
8. A complete **Ledger** records every transaction  

This system is ideal for:
- 🎓 FinTech coursework & MBA demos  
- 🧪 Proof-of-concept blockchain charity apps  
- 🚀 Smart-contract simulation  
- 📱 Mobile-friendly donation prototypes
